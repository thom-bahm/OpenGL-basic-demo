# OceanOrWaterRendering
Trying to create a realistic dynamic body of water using Fast Fourier transform, most likely in ue4 or unity. Ultimate goal would be to have a landscape created in WorldCreator that the body of water could interact with, ideally keeping decent performance but priority may aim towards high graphics.
